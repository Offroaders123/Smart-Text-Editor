The text editor that requires only a browser and a keyboard!
  
This is a project that I am working on in my free time, and it has turned into something really useful!
I have started to implement features similar to that of a Progressive Web App, so it can be opened/used through the browser like most websites, or as close to a normal desktop/smartphone/tablet app as possible! I personally find the idea super interesting, so I will continue to learn more about it.

## How to Use
This project can be opened with GitHub Pages, as well as installed to your device's desktop, app drawer, toolbar, or home screen!

*A note ahead of time: If you are using Grammarly or another text editing-focused extension on lower-end hardware, I have run into performance issues when editing large files with Smart Text Editor, so I recommend disabling it for use with Smart Text Editor if it isn't necessary for your task at hand (If you aren't writing an essay or something with normal grammar/spelling). However, this is just for performance concerns, so if your device can handle it, it is perfectly fine to leave such extensions enabled!*

- I am not able to try this process out myself as I don't have an Android device to test it on, but I have added support for this if you would like to try it out! Any feedback on this would be helpful!

This is a very fun project to work on, and I can't wait to see what it grows into as the development moves along!
